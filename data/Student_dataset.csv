Pink Floyd,Time,1973,classic,"*ticking clocks* *clocks ringing*   Ticking away The moments that make up a dull day You fritter and waste the hours In an offhand way Kicking around on a piece of ground In your hometown Waiting for someone Or something to show you the way  Tired of lying in the sunshine Staying home to watch the rain You are young and life is long And there is time to kill today And then one day you find Ten years have got behind you No one told you when to run You missed the starting gun   And you run, and you run To catch up with the sun, but it's sinking And racing around To come up behind you again The sun is the same in a relative way But you're older Shorter of breath And one day closer to death  Every year is getting shorter Never seem to find the time Plans that either come to naught Or half a page of scribbled lines Hanging on in quiet desperation Is the English way The time is gone, the song is over Thought I'd something more to say   Home, home again I like to be here when I can When I come home cold and tired It's good to warm my bones beside the fire Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell Calls the faithful to their knees To hear the softly spoken magic spells"

Youve captured my mind My heart, my soul, no, no You're the one I'm waiting for Every time I look into your eyes I see my paradise Stars are shining right up in the sky Painting words of desire        ,   -        ,   -    ,    ,      ,                        ,        ,        ,     "
Queen,I Want It All - Single Version,2022,classic,"I want it all (Hey, yeah), I want it all I want it all, and I want it now  Adventure seeker on an empty street Just an alley creeper light on his feet A young fighter screaming With no time for doubt With the pain and anger Can't see a way out  ""It ain't much I'm asking"" I heard him say ""Got to find me a future Move out of my way""  I want it all, I want it all I want it all, and I want it now I want it all, I want it all I want it all, and I want it now  Listen, all you people, come gather 'round I gotta get me a game plan Gotta shake you to the ground Just give me what I know is mine People, do you hear me? Just give me the sign  It ain't much I'm asking If you want the truth Here's to the future For the dreams of youth  I want it all, I want it all (Give it all, I want it all) I want it all, and I want it now (Hey) I want it all, I want it all (Yes, I want it all, hey) I want it all, and I want it now  I'm a man with a one-track mind So much to do in one lifetime (People, do you hear me?) Not a man for compromise And where's and why's and living lies So I'm living it all (Yes, I'm living it all) And I'm giving it all (And I'm giving it all, ooh, yeah) (Yeah, yeah, yeah) (I want it all)   It ain't much I'm asking If you want the truth Here's to the future Hear the cry of youth (Hear the cry, hear the cry of youth)  I want it all, I want it all I want it all, and I want it now I want it all, I want it all (Hey, yeah, yeah) I want it all, and I want it now (Ooh, ooh) I want it now  I want it, I want it! Oooh, huh!"
Umberto Tozzi,Gloria,1979,classic," Gloria, manchi tu nell'aria Manchi ad una mano Che lavora piano Manchi a questa bocca Che cibo pi non tocca E sempre questa storia Che lei la chiamo Gloria Gloria, sui tuoi fianchi La mattina nasce il sole Entra odio ed esce amore Dal nome Gloria  Gloria, manchi tu nell'aria Manchi come il sale Manchi pi del sole Sciogli questa neve Che soffoca il mio petto T'aspetto, Gloria Gloria (Gloria), chiesa di campagna (Gloria) Acqua nel deserto (Gloria) Lascio aperto il cuore (Gloria) Scappa senza far rumore Dal lavoro, dal tuo letto Dai gradini di un altare T'aspetto, Gloria  Ah, ah, Gloria, per chi accende il giorno E invece di dormire Con la memoria torna A un tuffo nei papaveri In una terra libera Per chi respira nebbia Per chi respira rabbia Per me che senza Gloria Con te nuda sul divano Faccio stelle di cartone Pensando a Gloria  Gloria, manchi tu nell'aria Manchi come il sale Manchi pi del sole Sciogli questa neve Che soffoca il mio petto T'aspetto, Gloria Gloria (Gloria), chiesa di campagna (Gloria) Acqua nel deserto (Gloria) Lascio aperto il cuore (Gloria) Scappa senza far rumore Dal lavoro, dal tuo letto Dai gradini di un altare T'aspetto, Gloria "
